      "description": "`furo-ui5-busyindicator`\nThe furo-ui5-busyindicator signals that some operation is going on and that the user must wait. It does not block\nthe current UI screen so other operations could be triggered in parallel.\nUsage\nFor the furo-ui5-busyindicator you can define the size of the indicator, as well as whether it is shown or hidden.\nIn order to hide it, use the html attribute hidden or display: none;\n\nIn order to show busy state for an HTML element, simply nest the HTML element in a furo-ui5-busyindicator instance.\nNote: Since furo-ui5-busyindicator has display: inline-block; by default and no width of its own, whenever you need\nto wrap a block-level element, you should set display: block to the busy indicator as well.\n\nWhat is different from ui5-busyindicator?\nWith flow based programming it's usual to address functions. So we added two convenience functions for\n- activate => ƒ-activate\n- deactivate => ƒ-deactivate\n\nhttps://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/playground/components/BusyIndicator/",
