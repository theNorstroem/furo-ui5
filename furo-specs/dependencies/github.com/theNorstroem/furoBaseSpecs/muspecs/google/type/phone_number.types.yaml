    google.type.PhoneNumber #An object representing a phone number, suitable as an API wire format.

     This representation:

      - should not be used for locale-specific formatting of a phone number, such
        as "+1 (650) 253-0000 ext. 123"

      - is not designed for efficient storage
      - may not be suitable for dialing - specialized libraries (see references)
        should be used to parse the number for that purpose

     To do something meaningful with this number, such as format it for various
     use-cases, convert it to an `i18n.phonenumbers.PhoneNumber` object first.

     For instance, in Java this would be:

        com.google.type.PhoneNumber wireProto =
            com.google.type.PhoneNumber.newBuilder().build();
        com.google.i18n.phonenumbers.Phonenumber.PhoneNumber phoneNumber =
            PhoneNumberUtil.getInstance().parse(wireProto.getE164Number(), "ZZ");
        if (!wireProto.getExtension().isEmpty()) {
          phoneNumber.setExtension(wireProto.getExtension());
        }

  fields:
    e164_number: |-
        string:1 [kind] #The phone number, represented as a leading plus sign ('+'), followed by a
         phone number that uses a relaxed ITU E.164 format consisting of the
         country calling code (1 to 3 digits) and the subscriber number, with no
         additional spaces or formatting, e.g.:
          - correct: "+15552220123"
          - incorrect: "+1 (555) 222-01234 x123".

         The ITU E.164 format limits the latter to 12 digits, but in practice not
         all countries respect that, so we relax that restriction here.
         National-only numbers are not allowed.

    extension: |-
        string:3 #The phone number's extension. The extension is not standardized in ITU
         recommendations, except for being defined as a series of numbers with a
         maximum length of 40 digits. Other than digits, some other dialing
         characters such as ',' (indicating a wait) or '#' may be stored here.

         Note that no regions currently use extensions with short codes, so this
         field is normally only set in conjunction with an E.164 number. It is held
         separately from the E.164 number to allow for short code extensions in the
         future.
