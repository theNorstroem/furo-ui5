- enum: |-
    google.api.FieldBehavior #An indicator of the behavior of a given field (for example, that a field
     is required in requests, or given as output but ignored as input).
     This **does not** change the behavior in protocol buffers itself; it only
     denotes the behavior and may affect how API tooling handles the field.

     Note: This enum **may** receive new values in the future.
  values:
    FIELD_BEHAVIOR_UNSPECIFIED: 0
    OPTIONAL: 1
    REQUIRED: 2
    OUTPUT_ONLY: 3
    INPUT_ONLY: 4
