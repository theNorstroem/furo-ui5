         The scheme is used to determine the backend protocol and security.
         The following schemes are accepted:

            SCHEME        PROTOCOL    SECURITY
            http://       HTTP        None
            https://      HTTP        TLS
            grpc://       gRPC        None
            grpcs://      gRPC        TLS

         It is recommended to explicitly include a scheme. Leaving out the scheme
         may cause constrasting behaviors across platforms.

         If the port is unspecified, the default is:
         - 80 for schemes without TLS
         - 443 for schemes with TLS

         For HTTP backends, use [protocol][google.api.BackendRule.protocol]
         to specify the protocol version.
    deadline: |-
        double:3 #The number of seconds to wait for a response from a request. The default
         varies based on the request protocol and deployment environment.
    min_deadline: |-
        double:4 #Minimum deadline in seconds needed for this method. Calls having deadline
         value lower than this will be rejected.
    operation_deadline: |-
        double:5 #The number of seconds to wait for the completion of a long running
         operation. The default is no deadline.
    path_translation: 'google.api.BackendRule.PathTranslation:6 #'
    jwt_audience: |-
        string:7 [authentication] #The JWT audience is used when generating a JWT ID token for the backend.
         This ID token will be added in the HTTP "authorization" header, and sent
         to the backend.
    disable_auth: |-
        bool:8 [authentication] #When disable_auth is true, a JWT ID token won't be generated and the
         original "Authorization" HTTP header will be preserved. If the header is
         used to carry the original token and is expected by the backend, this
         field must be set to true to preserve the header.
    protocol: |-
        string:9 #The protocol used for sending a request to the backend.
         The supported values are "http/1.1" and "h2".

         The default value is inferred from the scheme in the
         [address][google.api.BackendRule.address] field:

            SCHEME        PROTOCOL
            http://       http/1.1
            https://      http/1.1
            grpc://       h2
            grpcs://      h2

         For secure HTTP backends (https://) that support HTTP/2, set this field
         to "h2" for improved performance.

         Configuring this field to non-default values is only supported for secure
         HTTP backends. This field will be ignored for all other backends.

         for more details on the supported values.
