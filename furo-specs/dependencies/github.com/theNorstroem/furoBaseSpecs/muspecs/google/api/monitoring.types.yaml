    google.api.Monitoring #Monitoring configuration of the service.

     The example below shows how to configure monitored resources and metrics
     for monitoring. In the example, a monitored resource and two metrics are
     defined. The `library.googleapis.com/book/returned_count` metric is sent
     to both producer and consumer projects, whereas the
     `library.googleapis.com/book/num_overdue` metric is only sent to the
     consumer project.

         monitored_resources:
         - type: library.googleapis.com/Branch
           display_name: "Library Branch"
           description: "A branch of a library."

             description: "The location of the library branch."
           - key: branch_id
             description: "The id of the branch."
         metrics:
         - name: library.googleapis.com/book/returned_count
           display_name: "Books Returned"
           description: "The count of books that have been returned."
           launch_stage: GA
           metric_kind: DELTA
           value_type: INT64
           unit: "1"
           labels:

             description: "The id of the customer."
         - name: library.googleapis.com/book/num_overdue
           display_name: "Books Overdue"

  fields:

        [] google.api.Monitoring.MonitoringDestination:1 #Monitoring configurations for sending metrics to the producer project.
         There can be multiple producer destinations. A monitored resource type may
         appear in multiple monitoring destinations if different aggregations are
         needed for different sets of metrics associated with that monitored
         resource type. A monitored resource and metric pair may only be used once
         in the Monitoring configuration.
    consumer_destinations: |-
        [] google.api.Monitoring.MonitoringDestination:2 #Monitoring configurations for sending metrics to the consumer project.
         There can be multiple consumer destinations. A monitored resource type may
         appear in multiple monitoring destinations if different aggregations are
         needed for different sets of metrics associated with that monitored
         resource type. A monitored resource and metric pair may only be used once
         in the Monitoring configuration.
