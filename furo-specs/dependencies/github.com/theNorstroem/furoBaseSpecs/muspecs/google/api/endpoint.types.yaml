    google.api.Endpoint #`Endpoint` describes a network endpoint that serves a set of APIs.
     A service may expose any number of endpoints, and all endpoints share the
     same service configuration, such as quota configuration and monitoring
     configuration.

     Example service configuration:

         name: library-example.googleapis.com
         endpoints:
           # Below entry makes 'google.example.library.v1.Library'
           # API be served from endpoint address library-example.googleapis.com.
           # It also allows HTTP OPTIONS calls to be passed to the backend, for
           # it to decide whether the subsequent cross-origin request is
           # allowed to proceed.
         - name: library-example.googleapis.com
           allow_cors: true
  fields:
    name: 'string:1 #The canonical name of this endpoint.'
    aliases: |-
        [] string:2 #DEPRECATED: This field is no longer supported. Instead of using aliases,
         please specify multiple [google.api.Endpoint][google.api.Endpoint] for each of the intended
         aliases.

        string:101 #The specification of an Internet routable address of API frontend that will
         handle requests to this [API
         Endpoint](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/glossary). It should be
         either a valid IPv4 address or a fully-qualified domain name. For example,
         "8.8.8.8" or "myservice.appspot.com".

         [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing), aka
         cross-domain traffic, would allow the backends served from this endpoint to
         receive and respond to HTTP OPTIONS requests. The response will be used by
         the browser to determine whether the subsequent cross-origin request is
         allowed to proceed.
