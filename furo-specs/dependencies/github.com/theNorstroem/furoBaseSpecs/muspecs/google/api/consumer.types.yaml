    google.api.ProjectProperties #A descriptor for defining project properties for a service. One service may
     have many consumer projects, and the service may want to behave differently
     depending on some properties on the project. For example, a project may be
     associated with a school, or a business, or a government agency, a business
     type property on the project may affect how a service responds to the client.
     This descriptor defines which properties are allowed to be set on a project.

     Example:

        project_properties:
          properties:
          - name: NO_WATERMARK
            type: BOOL
            description: Allows usage of the API without watermarks.
          - name: EXTENDED_TILE_CACHE_PERIOD
            type: INT64
  fields:
    properties: '[] google.api.Property:1 #List of per consumer project-specific properties.'
  target: consumer.proto
- type: |-
    google.api.Property #Defines project properties.

     API services can define properties that can be assigned to consumer projects
     so that backends can perform response customization without having to make
     additional calls or maintain additional storage. For example, Maps API
     defines properties that controls map tile cache period, or whether to embed a
     watermark in a result.

     These values can be set via API producer console. Only API providers can
     define and set these properties.
  fields:
    name: 'string:1 #The name of the property (a.k.a key).'
    type: 'google.api.Property.PropertyType:2 #The type of this property.'
    description: 'string:3 #The description of the property'
  target: consumer.proto
