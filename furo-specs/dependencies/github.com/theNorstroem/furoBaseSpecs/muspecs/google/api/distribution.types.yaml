    google.api.Distribution #`Distribution` contains summary statistics for a population of values. It
     optionally contains a histogram representing the distribution of those values
     across a set of buckets.

     The summary statistics are the count, mean, sum of the squared deviation from
     the mean, the minimum, and the maximum of the set of population of values.
     The histogram is based on a sequence of buckets and gives a count of values
     that fall into each bucket. The boundaries of the buckets are given either
     explicitly or by formulas for buckets of fixed or exponentially increasing
     widths.

     Although it is not forbidden, it is generally a bad idea to include
     non-finite values (infinities or NaNs) in the population of values, as this
     will render the `mean` and `sum_of_squared_deviation` fields meaningless.
  fields:
    count: |-
        int64:1 #The number of values in the population. Must be non-negative. This value
         must equal the sum of the values in `bucket_counts` if a histogram is
         provided.
    mean: |-
        double:2 #The arithmetic mean of the values in the population. If `count` is zero
         then this field must be zero.
    sum_of_squared_deviation: |-
        double:3 #The sum of squared deviations from the mean of the values in the
         population. For values x_i this is:

             Sum[i=1..n]((x_i - mean)^2)

         Knuth, "The Art of Computer Programming", Vol. 2, page 232, 3rd edition
         describes Welford's method for accumulating this sum in one pass.

         If `count` is zero then this field must be zero.
    range: |-
        google.api.Distribution.Range:4 #If specified, contains the range of the population values. The field
         must not be present if the `count` is zero.
    bucket_options: |-
        google.api.Distribution.BucketOptions:6 #Defines the histogram bucket boundaries. If the distribution does not
         contain a histogram, then omit this field.
    bucket_counts: |-
        [] int64:7 #The number of values in each bucket of the histogram, as described in
         `bucket_options`. If the distribution does not have a histogram, then omit
         this field. If there is a histogram, then the sum of the values in
         `bucket_counts` must equal the value in the `count` field of the
         distribution.

         If present, `bucket_counts` should contain N values, where N is the number
         of buckets specified in `bucket_options`. If you supply fewer than N
         values, the remaining values are assumed to be 0.

         The order of the values in `bucket_counts` follows the bucket numbering
         schemes described for the three bucket types. The first value must be the
         count for the underflow bucket (number 0). The next N-2 values are the
         counts for the finite buckets (number 1 through N-2). The N'th value in
         `bucket_counts` is the count for the overflow bucket (number N-1).
