    google.api.Service #`Service` is the root object of Google service configuration schema. It
     describes basic information about a service, such as the name and the
     title, and delegates other aspects to sub-sections. Each sub-section is
     either a proto message or a repeated proto message that configures a
     specific aspect, such as auth. See each proto message definition for details.

     Example:

         type: google.api.Service
         config_version: 3
         name: calendar.googleapis.com
         title: Google Calendar API
         apis:
         - name: google.calendar.v3.Calendar
         authentication:
           providers:
           - id: google_calendar_auth
             jwks_uri: https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs
             issuer: https://securetoken.google.com
           rules:
           - selector: "*"
             requirements:
               provider_id: google_calendar_auth
  fields:
    config_version: 'google.protobuf.UInt32Value:20 #This field is obsolete. Its value must be set to `3`.'
    name: |-
        string:1 #The service name, which is a DNS-like logical identifier for the
         service, such as `calendar.googleapis.com`. The service name
         typically goes through DNS verification to make sure the owner
         of the service also owns the DNS name.
    id: |-
        string:33 #A unique ID for a specific instance of this message, typically assigned
         by the client for tracking purpose. Must be no longer than 63 characters
         and only lower case letters, digits, '.', '_' and '-' are allowed. If
         empty, the server may choose to generate one instead.
    title: 'string:2 #The product title for this service.'
    producer_project_id: 'string:22 #The Google project that owns this service.'
    apis: |-
        [] google.protobuf.Api:3 #A list of API interfaces exported by this service. Only the `name` field
         of the [google.protobuf.Api][google.protobuf.Api] needs to be provided by the configuration
         author, as the remaining fields will be derived from the IDL during the
         normalization process. It is an error to specify an API interface here
         which cannot be resolved against the associated IDL files.
    types: |-
        [] google.protobuf.Type:4 #A list of all proto message types included in this API service.
         Types referenced directly or indirectly by the `apis` are
         automatically included.  Messages which are not referenced but
         shall be included, such as types used by the `google.protobuf.Any` type,
         should be listed here by name. Example:

             types:
             - name: google.protobuf.Int32
    enums: |-
        [] google.protobuf.Enum:5 #A list of all enum types included in this API service.  Enums
         referenced directly or indirectly by the `apis` are automatically
         included.  Enums which are not referenced but shall be included
         should be listed here by name. Example:

             enums:
             - name: google.someapi.v1.SomeEnum
    documentation: 'google.api.Documentation:6 #Additional API documentation.'
    backend: 'google.api.Backend:8 #API backend configuration.'
    http: 'google.api.Http:9 #HTTP configuration.'
    quota: 'google.api.Quota:10 #Quota configuration.'
    authentication: 'google.api.Authentication:11 #Auth configuration.'
    context: 'google.api.Context:12 #Context configuration.'
    usage: 'google.api.Usage:15 #Configuration controlling usage of this service.'
    endpoints: |-
        [] google.api.Endpoint:18 #Configuration for network endpoints.  If this is empty, then an endpoint
         with the same name as the service is automatically generated to service all
         defined APIs.
    control: 'google.api.Control:21 #Configuration for the service control plane.'
    logs: '[] google.api.LogDescriptor:23 #Defines the logs used by this service.'
    metrics: '[] google.api.MetricDescriptor:24 #Defines the metrics used by this service.'
    monitored_resources: |-
        [] google.api.MonitoredResourceDescriptor:25 #Defines the monitored resources used by this service. This is required
         by the [Service.monitoring][google.api.Service.monitoring] and [Service.logging][google.api.Service.logging] configurations.
    billing: 'google.api.Billing:26 #Billing configuration.'
    logging: 'google.api.Logging:27 #Logging configuration.'
    monitoring: 'google.api.Monitoring:28 #Monitoring configuration.'
    system_parameters: 'google.api.SystemParameters:29 #System parameter configuration.'
