    google.api.Logging #Logging configuration of the service.

     The following example shows how to configure logs to be sent to the
     producer and consumer projects. In the example, the `activity_history`
     log is sent to both the producer and consumer projects, whereas the
     `purchase_history` log is only sent to the producer project.

         monitored_resources:
         - type: library.googleapis.com/branch
           labels:
           - key: /city
             description: The city where the library branch is located in.
           - key: /name
             description: The name of the branch.
         logs:
         - name: activity_history
           labels:
           - key: /customer_id
         - name: purchase_history
         logging:
           producer_destinations:
           - monitored_resource: library.googleapis.com/branch
             logs:
             - activity_history
             - purchase_history
           consumer_destinations:
           - monitored_resource: library.googleapis.com/branch
             logs:
             - activity_history
  fields:
    producer_destinations: |-
        [] google.api.Logging.LoggingDestination:1 #Logging configurations for sending logs to the producer project.
         There can be multiple producer destinations, each one must have a
         different monitored resource type. A log can be used in at most
         one producer destination.
    consumer_destinations: |-
        [] google.api.Logging.LoggingDestination:2 #Logging configurations for sending logs to the consumer project.
         There can be multiple consumer destinations, each one must have a
         different monitored resource type. A log can be used in at most
         one consumer destination.
