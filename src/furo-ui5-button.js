/**
 * `furo-ui5-button`
 * The furo-ui5-button component represents a simple push button. It enables users to trigger actions by clicking or
 * tapping the furo-ui5-button, or by pressing certain keyboard keys, such as Enter.
 * Usage
 * For the furo-ui5-button UI, you can define text, icon, or both. You can also specify whether the text or the icon is displayed first.
 *
 * You can choose from a set of predefined types that offer different styling to correspond to the triggered action.
 *
 * You can set the furo-ui5-button as enabled or disabled.
 * An enabled ui5-button can be pressed by clicking or tapping it.
 * The button changes its style to provide visual feedback to the user that it is pressed or hovered over with the mouse cursor.
 * A disabled furo-ui5-button appears inactive and cannot be pressed.
 *
 * What is different from ui5-button?
 * With flow based programming it's usual to address functions. So we added two convenience functions for
 * - disabling => ƒ-disable
 * - enabling => ƒ-enable
